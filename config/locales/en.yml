    biography_p1: "Born in 1938, he studies fine arts at the University Concordia, Montreal, Canada."
    biography_p2: "He works between Paris, Nîmes and Montreal (Canada).
                  He taught the plastic arts during 30 years in diverse institutions and universities in North America.
                  Member of the Royal Academy of the Arts of Canada and association Kepes de Budapest, Hungary. Since the environment of the 60s, he explores the movement by the motorized mechanics, the digital searches, the animations algorithmics and the neon."
    biography_p3: "He expresses by means of a simple geometry, his observations of the world, forms to the which he gives a continuous slow movement of growth and decrease.
                  Being made, form spaces and colors are put in relation some with the others so favoring, the harmony of the composition in a spatiotemporal continuum, the quite organic sensualism."

    g-thomat-title: "Gilles Thomat, film-maker"
    g-thomat-text-1: "Gilles Thomat nous invite dans les ateliers d'artistes, il les filme au travail, concentrés, maniant le fusain, le pinceau, les ciseaux, les outils..."
    g-thomat-text-2: "Nous découvrons une chose rare, l’artiste dans son atelier, dans le silence de la création."
    g-thomat-text-3: "Dans ces films, il n’y a pas de dialogue, pas de commentaire, pas d’échange avec l’artiste."
    g-thomat-text-4: "Et pourtant, par la relation profonde et intime qu’il a réussi à mettre en place avec chacun d’entre eux, Gilles Thomat a trouvé la bonne place, la place juste, comme un révélateur."
    g-thomat-text-5: "Par la sensibilité et la précision de son regard, il est allé à l’essentiel, par bouts, par fragments. Il a su capter la lumière, le noir, la couleur, il s’arrête sur une main, une épaule."
    g-thomat-text-6: "Au son, c’est la même chose, fragments, sensations, souffle...
      Ces films sont comme des révélations, pourtant le mystère reste entier."
