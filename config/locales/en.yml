    biography: Né en 1938, au Liban, il fait ses études de beaux arts à l'Université
      Concordia, Montréal, Canada. Il travaille entre Paris, Nîmes et Montréal (Canada).
      Il a enseigné les Arts Plastiques pendant 30 ans dans diverses institutions
      et universités en Amérique du Nord. Membre de l'Académie Royale des Arts du
      Canada et de l'association Kepes de Budapest, Hongrie. Depuis le milieu des
      années 60, il explore le mouvement par la mécanique motorisée, les recherches
      numériques, des animations algorithmiques et le néon. Il exprime par le biais
      d'une géométrie simple, ses observations du monde, des formes auxquelles il
      donne un mouvement lent, continu de croissance et décroissance. Se faisant,
      formes, espaces et couleurs sont mis en relation les uns avec les autres privilégiant
      ainsi, l'harmonie de la composition dans un continuum spatio-temporel, d'une
      sensualitétoute organique.

      text_html: "« Since potentially everything exists, creating is discovering and
        making visible or manifest what is latent » «...Esthetically kinetics allow
        me to give preference to the harmony of a continuum motion in time and space.
        I look forward to express, the synergy between time and real motion created
        within a specific space, the expression of motion through motion and the apparent
        simultaneous complexities of constant vibrations andchanges in sizes and proportions
        that surrounds us to the harmony of motion in time and space...» « MOVEMENT
        RESEARCHER, essay on my work » « Touch algorithm » «Defense not to touch»
        In the sixties in France, G.R.A.V., Visual Arts Research Group, issued the
        following principles: “Defense not to touch” and “Defense not to participate”.
        For Roger Vilder, who is currently exhibiting at the NMarino gallery in Paris,
        these injunctions are now at their full value. For this artist who has shared
        his life between Canada and France, works on art built in conjunction with
        those on the movement bring him closer to this story written by the proponents
        of kinetic art. For it is an itinerary of fifty years which ends today with
        this proposal of “Touch algorithm”. Roger Vilder’s first digital research
        dates back to 1971. In 1973 he made computer drawings at the Meteorological
        Center of Canada. Now, for Roger Vilder, this desire to combine creation in
        the field of visual arts with computer technology is realized with these black
        and white or color drawings animated by algorithms, the tables becoming permanently
        modified by random or repetitive movements . The surface of the screen- painting
        is then enslaved by the computer to the benefit of a work in constant change."

      text_html: 'Departing from the classical constructivist’s morphology and syntax,
        Roger Vilder’s vision has developed without complex nor constrainst to the
        liking of an all oriental sensuality. It is through the temporary terms of
        the geometrical langage that he undertakes to shout out his love of life and
        communicating this to us. « I am a powerless god because I do not accept my
        own weaknesses » he tells us in a text written in Montreal in February 1970.
        This recognition is a whole program in itself. This « son of the mediteranean
        sea and sun » has gone to live the great northern experience and the wideopen
        spaces. Without emphasizing the sentimental side of all biographical reference,
        there is something else than a simple hazard to his personal migration though
        time and space in geography and history. If Vilder resorts to geometric forms,
        it is because he intends to reach depths, to express the essence of life through
        its constant metamorphosis. His animated reliefs showing the relentless crossing
        of two perpandicular lines expresses one Mondrian and all the Mondrian of
        the world. Life is the squaring of the circle and Vilder knows well that computer
        design has solved the problem. On the formal plan, and uniquely on this one
        of course, because the secret of life, which is also that of the magical wand,
        is the eternal comeback, etrnal beginning, eternal starting over ‘ab ovo’.
        This eternal starting over of life is not a miracal but a reason to live.
        In a recent film scenario (October 1972) Roger Vilder describes the extreme
        amplitude of an elementary metamorphosis. A cluster of dots inscribed in a
        perfect square, becomes birds flying in an amboid cloud shape, which becomes
        a school of fish swimming, becoming a herd of sheep running around, seen from
        above, which turns back to the initial dots within the square. Here, the spirit
        of geometry identifies itself with a deep instinct apprehending primary elements
        of existence. My meeting with Roger Vilder was quick, simple, decisive. I
        beleive in the simple tenacity of this sorcerer without miracles, at his crazy
        love of life, at his mystical realism and all that he bears within him of
        instinct that he expresses spontaneously : the kind of people are rare, they
        do not bother themselves with formal contingencies of the already seen or
        done and obstinately look at the world with constantly renewed eyes.'

      text_html: "...As I begin to write this text, I have before my eyes a great
        piece of tree-root found some months ago on a shore in Brittany, and which
        I’ve mounted on a stand. Rolled around by the waves, hollowed out by stones
        and salt, it’s a delight for the eyes and for the mind : an ocean sculpture,
        looking more interesting, saying more than The Victory of Samothrace. I’d
        say something of the same for the stones gathered round the world I have laid
        out here in this atelier : a block of sandstone layered in grey and black
        from the Lofoten, a slab of grey and rosy clay from the Sierra de Grazalema
        in Spain, and that mauve stone from a river bed on Guadeloupe. It’s not only
        an aesthetic satisfaction linked to form and colour that these objects provide,
        it’s a sense of the forces at play in the universe. And with human beings
        that’s a deep need. The human being has as much need of communication with
        the universe as of social communication. And there you have the ultimate motivation
        of the deepest art : the movements (of animals), the flight (of a band of
        migratory birds), the curve (of a wave), the gleam (of a stroke of lightning)
        — events that awaken the desire to do something similar, to be somehow worthy
        of the cosmos. Without such communication, without this contact, there will
        of course be productions called «art» and «culture». But, descending from
        one artificial artefact to the other, this « art », this « culture », will
        end up in the most trivial fantasy or in a complacent milling about in ugliness
        and insignificance. All the great artists have always known this. That’s why
        Rimbaud says that if he has a taste for anything, it’s for «earth and stones».
        That’s why Saint-John Perse evokes the sea as «showing the way to the greatest
        text» and why Artaud calls for «an organic idea of culture». It’s in this
        field of premises, both radical and radiating, that I place the art of Roger
        Vilder. Vilder began (and a real artist never forgets his beginnings, he develops
        them) with a very strong sense of geometry: not only a sense of line and form,
        but «a measuring of the earth». I’m thinking there of his 16 cubes in solid
        aluminium and his 4 white lines of neon. In such work, he is constructivist:
        the lines are regular — horizontal or vertical. Then the lines break, and
        become movement: the constructions are deconstructed (but without losing form,
        without turning into futility), the geometry becomes more complex. This is
        where constructivism converts to organicism: the regular or broken lines evoke
        now bee-swarms, a herd of moving animals, the flight of birds, meteorological
        whirlings of matter. This is where the linear art of Roger Vilder discovers
        the open world, with its geo-graphies and its geo-logies. Walt Whitman said
        one day, way back in the nineteenth century, in the course of an excursion
        to Colorado, facing a chaotic pile of rocks, that he would give up anything
        commonly called «art» if only he could render the sensation with which those
        rocks filled his mind. In a similar way, Vilder has walked among the great
        rock-masses of Monument Valley and around Powell Lake. They were a lesson
        to him, because he was able not just to admire them, but to read them, that
        is, to follow their lines. And then, in the bed of a river in Canada, he came
        across strange stones. Again, a shock of reality, and the desire to let it
        be seen and felt by others. He decides to give these stones art-status by
        reproducing them in bronze. This series of bronzen stones is a whole world,
        not only mineral, but organic and even totemic: both archaic and anarchic,
        representative and abstract. In my reading of Vilder’s work, after the initial
        geometry, then the geography-geology, there is, as a third stage, geopoetics.
        There I’m thinking of those wavescapes, those sand-patterns, those crystal-clusters,
        stellar agglomerations and nebulas one finds in his glasswork, where force,
        form and light come together in an art that is complete, where the rhythms
        of the world, fracture zones included, are concentrated. One particular glass-piece
        comes to mind: totality in movement, beautiful harmony, singularity and multiplicity
        combined, clarified cosmology — a masterpiece. Art, the mind in its furthest
        reaches, tends towards a cosmos. Not necessarily a paradise, but a cosmos.
        It’s this cosmological movement I see at work in the art of Roger Vilder."

      text_html: 'To say that the works of Vilder shown in this exhibition are Mondrians
        set in motion would neither Go very far, nor would mean very much. However,
        if one insists upon evoquing Mondrian in the context of Vilders work, one
        can do it judiciously, as Tommaso Trini who wrote two years ago: MONDRIAN
        STARTS FROM A TREE TO BUILD A GEOMETRICAL ABSTRACTION, WHEREAS VILDER DEALS
        WITH THE OPTICAL RENDERING OF THE VITAL PULSATIONS OF THE SAME TREE. It would
        certainly be a mistake not to go beyond the geometry of vertical and horizontal
        lines in our interrogation of the work. Geometry is present only as a metaphor,
        and Vilder points out that EACH WORK IS AN ATTEMPT TO GRAP THE SECRETS OF
        LIFE. Pierre Restany is right to speak of the RELENTLESS CROSSING OF THE PERPENDICULAR
        LINES: indeed the pieces of Vilder breathe and move in a slow, smooth and
        unform way. Whereas the cycle of the 1966 gear pieces was short, lasting through
        a single revolution of the elementary Gestalt wheel, it became longer in the
        expanding and contracting pieces that followed and longer still in the new
        works since 1970. Some of these would have to be in continuous operation for
        more than four years, twenty-four hours a day, for us to see them repeat a
        given configuration. The scenario of verticals and horizontals that Vilder
        has organized offers us continuous movements along which there is no place
        for prime moments. The movements questions all the instantaneous states of
        the system. There is no particular instant where the orthogonal lines would
        offer proportions in the division of the surface that would be more harmonious
        or more interesting. Rather than in a particular stage, or a necessarily fugitive
        state of the configuration, it is in the system itself that we have to look
        for the source of q continued harmony that ties what is with what has just
        been and with what will be. It was quite natural for Vilder to be attracted
        by the use of cinema and its temporality. As early as 1970, he conceived a
        film for which trial runs were made in video from the graphic screen of a
        computer in 1971, and the scenario of which was completed in 1972. It is an
        ambitious project, which no doubt will be extremely difficult to carry through.
        But it deals with questions which are the heart of Vilders problematic, such
        as movement, cycle or the relation of the unit to the whole. A square made
        up of dots softens into an amoebic shape, only one dot remains visible and
        evolves into a bird, a cloud or birds, a flock of fish seen from the sky,
        a school of fish, one fish, a single scale which in turns becomes a dot that
        brings us back to the dots of the original square. This project calls for
        sophisticated transformation sequences which have to be carried out with the
        help of computer animation and there are important technical problems to be
        solved. In addition Vilder has produced several short animated films and videotapes
        and the computer allowed him to create works that most often would have been
        impossible to achieve with conventional mechanical means. For example, the
        film which is shown during this exhibition depicts a square divided into a
        certain number of coloured rectangular areas the surfaces of which vary continuously.
        The film was conceived in 1971, prepared in 1972, shot a first time in 1973,
        re-shot in 1974 and finally edited in 1975. The difficulties of this completion
        demonstrate the energy and power of conviction needed to succeed in producing
        such a film outside the normal channels. Vilders work of the last ten years
        always remained of excellent quality. The successive series of works were
        all fascinating and very powerful when they appeared and the older ones as
        well as the latest keep intact this power of conviction that so many kinetic
        works never had or promptly lost by being light or decorative gadgets. Vilder
        is a classic and his pieces work not as simple objects to view, but as objects
        of knowledge and tools for meditation with which one would want to live.'

      text_html: 'And it will be perfect if the work makes you forget the painting,
        «the work of art.» Roger Vilder, with his «Touch Algorithms», thus installs
        this new relationship in artistic creation. The mutation of the work of art
        does not seem to me to be due, first of all, to technological progress but
        rather to this new status: the painting on the wall is not a finished, definitive
        object, it becomes an interactive, modifiable element, subject to the will
        of its owner, who owns this share of creativity. The dream of G.R.A.V. to
        see the birth of a «Defense not to touch» artists G.R.A.V. finds here a new
        application with the use by Roger Vilder of touch screens that singularly
        disrupt the status of both the work and that of the artist. From now on, the
        collector takes his share of creation for each work initiated by the artist.
        The spectator of the painting has decision-making power by intervening on
        the tactile plane: it can then move the image, enlarge a shape, reduce it,
        modify the geometric ratio of shapes and colors. In these conditions, it is
        not only the nature of the work that changes by being attributed an additional
        actor in the act of creation, it is the very status of the artist that is
        upset. By putting this decision-making power at the disposal of the spectator,
        Roger Vilder puts in a situation an unpublished tandem which, in a certain
        way, desacralizes the role of the creator, the indisputable pre-eminence of
        the artist. Imagine a painting by Mondrian modified to suit the humor of the
        collector? What would Mondrian himself think of it? How is the concept of
        the author defined? With this proposal of «Touch Algorithm», Roger Vilder
        puts on the work the question of the relation to the art that the artists
        of G.R.A.V. posed half a century ago. Among its members, Julio Le Parc declared
        as early as 1961: “Art does not interest us as such. It is for us a way to
        provide visual sensations, a material highlighting your gifts. Everyone is
        gifted, everyone can become a partner. new relationship between the artist
        and the viewer takes shape today with this art of sharing.”'

      text_html: 'The kinetic objects of Roger Vilder are the synthesis of the geometrical
        order and the organic mutation, but they go far beyond. It is an innovative
        understanding of the morphological processes that his art proposes to us and
        not an umpteenth innovation of form in art. Who is Vilder: a Canadian artist
        of Lebanese origin, who until ’71 works in Montreal, and who has since traveled
        and exhibited throughout Europe. We discover his work at the most important
        crossroads of the formal field of art. Vilder, heir of constructivist resolutions,
        develops them in their formal manifestation - geometric language plus movement
        - in order to recompose the dichotomy between geometrical form and organic
        form. It is true that modern art has been extensively and severely divided
        as to the choice of one or the other form. But these choices have always invested
        a deeper problem, that of the relations between art and life, between the
        autonomy of the specific means of painting and the reference data of reality.
        In order not to continue this illusory choice, we are currently working on
        a possible third path that is neither the geometrical nor the organic form,
        research in which minimal sculpture, land art, process art have been launched.
        Vilder tells us not a third way, but the need to immerse ourselves in the
        metamorphoses of this 3rd infinity which is the organization of the matter
        of which we are made. After exploring the infinity of stars, interplanetary
        space, after exploring the molecular infinity, the vision of the genetic and
        vital dimension. Vilder’s works until the 1970s featured expansions and contractions
        of elastic forms by visible mechanical processes, so that geometry is more
        the pattern of a code of learning from reality than true artistic language.
        This artistic language, which is also neoplastic with works animated from
        ’71 to the present day, where the intersection and divergence of lines (up
        to disappear at sight), straight lines, orthogonal, luminescent, etc. in fact
        a network of observation of the movement. Space is that of the painting in
        appearance, but the elementary mutation of forms comes from the association
        of the geometrical and the organic. If Mondrian is the geometrical abstraction
        of a tree, then Vilder is the optical restitution of the vital pulse of that
        same tree. It is interesting to recall the experiments conducted by Vilder
        in Montreal with the computer graphic. On the basis of some works he mixed
        2 programs of visual patterns to study the formation of lines that become
        squares. The new era of software ware opens unimaginable horizons to the problems
        raised by Vilder. The most direct solution - he says - is provided by the
        use of cinema and its temporality. Here he is a screenwriter of an experimental
        film on “movement and relationship between unity and the whole” where a perfect
        square, molecular organization of small points, transforms into an organic
        form of amoeba, becoming a flock of birds flying in the sky, into a school
        of fish in the sea and a flock of sheep running on the ground taking us on
        a journey in the air, the water and on earth, and finally getting back to
        the original square made of dots. The transformations of the geometric image
        to the organic one require an animation technique that the computer can provide.
        The present tributes to constructivism are proof that the work of Vilder is
        the coherent extension of a research which has become classical and which
        can be recognized as a scientific legitimacy. However, these works also contain
        a principle of negation or even self-destruction, depending on the structure
        of each biomorphic organization of matter. What compensates in terms of aesthetic
        verification the apparent degree of mechanization and programming of the work'
